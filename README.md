## 🇮🇳 About ChikitsaAI – Built in India, for India

**ChikitsaAI** is a community-driven, open-source initiative developed by **Prathamesh More**, a full-stack and AI engineer from Amravati, Maharashtra, India 🇮🇳. It aims to bridge the gap between medical data complexity and accessibility using modern artificial intelligence.

As India progresses toward digital health infrastructure through programs like the **Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)**, **ChikitsaAI** was created to:

* ✅ Empower doctors with **intelligent summaries** of lab reports and prescriptions
* ✅ Enable patients to **track and understand** their long-term medical history
* ✅ Assist clinics in **automating and digitizing health documents** using OCR + NLP
* ✅ Bring AI to **rural and resource-constrained health centers** at zero cost

> This solution respects user privacy, requires no cloud dependency, and is fully self-hostable.
